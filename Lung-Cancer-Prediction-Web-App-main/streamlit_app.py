         ## About
         
         Lung cancer is caused by the habit of SMOKING. Lung cancers usually are grouped into two main types called small cell and non-small cell. Symptoms includes wheezing, cough (with blood), shortness of breath, swallowing difficulty, chest pain. Different people have different symptoms for lung cancer. Most people with lung cancer donâ€™t have symptoms until the cancer is advanced. Treatments vary but may include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted drug therapy and immunotherapy.
             
         **This Streamlit App utilizes a Machine Learning API in order to detect lung cancer in patients based on the following criteria: age, gender, blood pressure, smoke, coughing, allergies, fatigue etc.**
